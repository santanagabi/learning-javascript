        >Julia and Kate are still studying dogs, and this time they are studying
        if dogs are eating too much or too little. </br>Eating too much means the
        dog's current food portion is larger than the recommended portion, and
        eating too little is the opposite. Eating an okay amount means the dog's
        current food portion is within a range 10% above and 10% below the
        recommended portion (see hint). Your tasks: </br>1. Loop over the 'dogs'
        array containing dog objects, and for each dog, calculate the
        recommended food portion and add it to the object as a new property. Do
        not create a new array, simply loop over the array. Forumla:
        recommendedFood = weight ** 0.75 * 28. (The result is in grams of food,
        and the weight needs to be in kg) </br>2. Find Sarah's dog and log to the
        console whether it's eating too much or too little. Hint: Some dogs have
        multiple owners, so you first need to find Sarah in the owners array,
        and so this one is a bit tricky (on purpose) � </br>3. Create an array
        containing all owners of dogs who eat too much ('ownersEatTooMuch') and
        an array with all owners of dogs who eat too little
        ('ownersEatTooLittle'). </br>4. Log a string to the console for each array
        created in 3., like this: "Matilda and Alice and Bob's dogs eat too
        much!" and "Sarah and John and Michael's dogs eat too little!" </br>5. Log to
        the console whether there is any dog eating exactly the amount of food
        that is recommended (just true or false) </br>6. Log to the console whether
        there is any dog eating an okay amount of food (just true or false)</br> 7.
        Create an array containing the dogs that are eating an okay amount of
        food (try to reuse the condition used in 6.)</br> 8. Create a shallow copy of
        the 'dogs' array and sort it by recommended food portion in an ascending
        order (keep in mind that the portions are inside the array's objects �)
